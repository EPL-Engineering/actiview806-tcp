## ActiView806-TCP
The [ActiView 8.06 software](https://www.biosemi.com/download.htm) for Biosemi's ActiveTwo system was modified to provide interprocess communication (IPD) via a TCP connection. The TCP control server allows a client application to automatically perform actions typically performed manually by the user, and to query the current state of ActiView.
